It displays sine waves with correct frequencies and lets you combine multiple notes. You can go up or down an octave using the left and right arrow keys. Sound volume (or amplitude) can be adjusted using the up and down arrow keys. It plays sounds using the correct frequencies, so you can also play music.
The keyboard layout can easily be adjusted in the code.
